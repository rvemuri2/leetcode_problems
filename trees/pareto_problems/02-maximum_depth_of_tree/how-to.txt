1. Use a BFS approach
2. have a level variable to keep track of the depth
3. increment the level after the for loop, but in the while loop
- this causes the level to increment by 1 after both the left side and right side are appended into the queue
4. return the level



for DFS: 

1. set base case of returning 0 if no root
2. for each iteration, set the left and right to 
the recursive call of the function to root.left and root.right
respectively
3. The height should be 1 + max(left, right) 
4. return the height
