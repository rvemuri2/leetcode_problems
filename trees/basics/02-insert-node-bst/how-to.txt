1. Base Case, if the root is null then we insert it there, as we return a TreeNode value
2. If the root val is less than val, then we go to the right and recurse there
3. If the root val is greater than val, then we go to the left and recurse there
4. Once we are done, we return the root

Time Complexity: O(h), O(log n) in BST
