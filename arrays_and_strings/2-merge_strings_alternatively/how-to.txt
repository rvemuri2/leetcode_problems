How to Solve the Problem 

1. Initialize an empty string and two pointers

2. go through each string and add to the empty string each char of each string, starting with 
the first pointer and then the second pointer

Note: First pointer points to first string, second pointer points to second string

3. Increment the two pointers, and do step 2 and 3 until first pointer reaches the end and second reaches the end
(whichever comes first)

4. If one of the strings wasn't completed in terms of the pointer reaching the end, add the rest of it to the new string

Time Complexity: O(n + m) -> O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n + m) -> O(n)
