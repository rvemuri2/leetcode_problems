How to solve the problem

1. Initialize two pointers and a count tracker

2. use a while loop, iterate through both strings

3. if two characters of both strings are matching, then we increment the pointers and the count

4. Else, we only increment the second pointer

5. After the loop, we can return True if the count tracker is equal to the length of the first string, 
what this tells us is that the string was counted for all the way through and proved to be a subsequence

6. else we can return false

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
