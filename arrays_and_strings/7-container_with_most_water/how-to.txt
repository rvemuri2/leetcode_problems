1. Use a two pointer approach, iniitialize i and j to 0 and len(height) - 1

2. set a result variable to 0

3. while(i < j), we want to see if i pointer is less than j pointer, 

4. If it is, then we calculate the height of the lower element * (j-1) which is the width

5. Get the max of that result with the calculation and result (stored in res)

6. Increment the right pointer 

7. Do similar steps of 4-6 except this time it's if j pointer <= i pointer, and if so 
we do same steps from 4-6 except now we decrement left pointer 

8. return the result variable
