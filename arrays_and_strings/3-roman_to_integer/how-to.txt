How to Solve the Problem 

1. Create a hashmap with all the roman numerals and their designated value

2. create a tracker for the sum (for integer value) and the index 

3. loop through the string with i (index)

4. In the loop, check if the index < length of string - 1 and if the next value of the string has 
a higher value in the hashmap than the current value of the string
    - if it does, then the sum would be += (higher value - lower value) from the hashmap 
    - the index would need to jump 2 spots ahead since we are calculating two positions

5. Else, we just add to the sum like usual with the value in the hashmap of current index, and then 
the index would just jump 1 spot like usual

6. return the sum 

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
