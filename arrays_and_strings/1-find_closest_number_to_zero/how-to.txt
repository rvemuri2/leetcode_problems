How to solve this problem

1. First, initialize trackers for the element in array and minimum number

2. iterate through the array, take the absolute value of each element

3. check if the absolute value < min_number, if it is, then make that abs(element) the min_number
and the curr to be the element

4. if there is a duplicate or just a negative inverse of the number, then take the max value of the current tracker
and the current element

5. return the current tracker 

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
