1. set a count and temp variable for getting length of longest subsequence 
and the temp variable for the element in list

2. Make the list into a set so that we avoid duplicate values

3. set a base case so that if it is empty array, we return 0

4. iterate through the set, set the temp as the curr element in array

5. if the number - 1 is not in the array, then we know that it is the root of the sequence, 
so if that is the case, we can start a streak variable and assign it as 1

6. while the number + 1 in the set, we can add 1 to the streak variable and increase temp by 1

7. after exiting the while loop, we get the max of the count and the curr element variable 

8. after the first loop, we just return the count
