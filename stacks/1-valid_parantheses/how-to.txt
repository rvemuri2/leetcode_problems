1. Create a hashmap of all the ending parantheticals and map it to the beginning of the parenthetical

2. use a stack, initialize it

3. loop through the string, first identify if it is an opening bracket

4. If it is, then we want to go ahead and add it to the stack

5. if it is a closing bracket, then we want to check if the stack is empty, if it is then we know that it's not valid

6. If there are elements in the stack, then we want to check if that element corresponds to the correct closing bracket, i.e: if it is ) in str, then the top of the stack should be (

7. If it doesn't correlate, then we can return False

8. After the loop, if the length of the stack > 0, we can say that it's not valid, if it is 0, then it is valid parantheses
