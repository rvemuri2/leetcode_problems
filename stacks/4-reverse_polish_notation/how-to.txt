1. Initialize a stack

2. loop through the tokens, and check if it is an operator

3. If it is an operator, pop the last two numbers from the stack

4. If it is addition or multiplication, we can just add or multiply the two numbers and then add it back to the stack 

5. If it is division or subtraction, we can divide or subtract the second number that is popped by the first number

Note: Round down in division, so use either Math.floor or just type cast int in python

6. if it is a number and not an operator, just add it to the stack

7. Return the first number of the stack
