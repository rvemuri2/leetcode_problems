1. Initialize two stacks, one for the minimum, and one in general for the problem

2. for the push method: we want to append to the general stack the value.
Next, if the min stack is empty, we can append the value.
If the min stack is not empty, we should append the minimum value between the top of the stack and the value getting passed in the function

3. For pop, we just pop from both the stacks

4. for top, we just look at the last element of the general stack

5. For getMin, we just look at last element of min stack 

Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(n)
