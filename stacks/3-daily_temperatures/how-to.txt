1. Initialize a stack and also a result array with 0's (total of length of the temperatures list)

2. loop through the temperatures array, 
and we want to see if the stack is not empty and to note, we are going to append the index (i or r in this case) to the stack, not the actual value

3. In that same if condition we want to see if the temperatures[stack[-1]] < current temperature which is temperatures[r]

4. If they are, we want to pop the index from the stack

5. Then, we want to fill in the index of the answer of the value that just got popped to be r-l since we want to fill it in with the distance

6. After the loop, we just want to return the answer array
