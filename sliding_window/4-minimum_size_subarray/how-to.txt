1. Initialize left pointer, length, and sum

2. Loop through the nums array

3. add the element to the sum

4. check if the sum >= target and if it is (use while loop), 
get the minimum length of the length and the window,
subtract the sum with the element
increase left pointer

5. after loop, return 0 if the length is same value as initial (infinity), otherwise return the length

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
