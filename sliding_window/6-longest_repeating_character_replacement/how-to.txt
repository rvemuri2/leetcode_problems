1. Initialize left pointer, hashmap, result for window length

2. Loop through the string

3. add the character to the hashmap

4. check if the window - max value of the hashmap is bigger than k,
if it is, then we need to subtract that character's value by 1
and move the left pointer

5. we set the result to the max of the result and the window

6. In the outer loop, we return the result
