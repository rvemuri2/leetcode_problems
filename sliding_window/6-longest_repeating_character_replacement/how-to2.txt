1. Initialize left pointer, hashmap, result for window length, and max frequency variable

2. Loop through the string

3. add the character to the hashmap

4. update max frequency with the max value of frequency and the value of the current key

4. check if the window - max frequency is bigger than k,
if it is, then we need to subtract that character's value by 1
and move the left pointer

5. we set the result to the max of the result and the window

6. In the outer loop, we return the result
