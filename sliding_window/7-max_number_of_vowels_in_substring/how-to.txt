1. Initialize left pointer, result, count, and a list with vowels
2. Loop through the string
3. if the char is a vowel, increment count
4. if the window is greater than k, increment left pointer, incidentally
before the incrementation, if the left pointer element is a vowel, then we
need to decrement the count variable
5. Set the result variable to the max of result and count variable
6. return the result variable
