1. Initialize left pointer, count, and sum variables

2. loop through the array

3. add the element to sum variable

4. If the window is greater than k, subtract the sum by the element and increase left pointer

5. If the window is equal to k, check if the average >= threshold, and if it is increase count variable

6. return the count outside the loop

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
