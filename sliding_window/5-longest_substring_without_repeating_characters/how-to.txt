1. Initialize left pointer, count, and set 

2. Loop through the array

3. when there are elements in the set already, keep removing them
and increment the left pointer

4. Take the max of the count and the window

5. add the element to the set

6. return the count

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
