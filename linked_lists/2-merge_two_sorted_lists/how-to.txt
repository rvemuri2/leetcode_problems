1. Create a dummy listNode and a curr pointer that points to that dummy listNode
2. loop through both lists 
3. if the value in one list is smaller than other list, point the next pointer to that value 
and increase the pointer of the list with that value
4. for each iteration, the curr pointer should move
5. if it's equal to or if the other value is smaller in another list, then do the same except for the other list
6. After the loop, if there are still elements remaining in one of the lists, then
add all those elements to the curr.next pointer 

Time Complexity: O(n + m) -> O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
