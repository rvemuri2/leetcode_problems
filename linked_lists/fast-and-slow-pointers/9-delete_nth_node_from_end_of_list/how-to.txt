1. Create a dummy node, set it to 0, set it at the beginning of the LL
2. set two pointers left and right. Left at dummy, right at head
3. loop through the LL, n > 0 and right
4. keep pushing right to the next
5. decrement n
6. Use another loop to just go through and push the left and right pointers until right is null
7. You will get to the point where the next of the left pointer is the one you want to delete
8. Delete the node by using left.next = left.next.next
9. return dummy.next (since we don't want the 0 to be included)

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
