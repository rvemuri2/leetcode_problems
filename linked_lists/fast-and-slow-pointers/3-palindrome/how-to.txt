1. Use fast and slow pointer technique to get the midpoint
2. loop through the LL
3. increment fast pointer as fast.next.next and the slow as just slow.next
4. Next, reverse the second half (right side) of the LL
5. Then, we want to just the traverse the two halves until the right pointer 
gets to the midpoint
6. Loop through using while(right)
7. if the two values are not equal, then return false
8. Outside the loop, return true

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
