1. define a prev for the previous value and assign curr to head
2. while curr is not null, we want to be able to reverse the list
3. store temp variable for curr.next 
4. set the next value to the prev (this is the reversing part)
5. then we set the previous value to the current value 
6. then we set the current value to the temp variable
