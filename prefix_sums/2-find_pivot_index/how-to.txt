1. store the sum of the list in variable
2. store the left sum in variable
3. loop through the nums array, 
4. calculate rightsum by getting the totalsum - current element - leftsum
5. if the left sum == right sum, then return the index
6. add the element to the left sum
7. if there's no match, return -1

Time Complexity: O(n)
