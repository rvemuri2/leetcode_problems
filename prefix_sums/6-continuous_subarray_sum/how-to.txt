1. Initialize a hashmap and sum variable
2. We want to set h[0] = -1 because we want to check for the edge
case of the first element being a multiple of 6, then the length is not >= 2, so that's why we initialize it to -1 as value

3. Loop through the nums array
4. add the element to the sum variable
5. initialize a variable, r, set it equal to the sum variable mod by k.
6. If the r variable is not in the hashmap, then we can go ahead and add h[r] = i into the hashmap
why? Because we want to see if the remainder is already in the hashmaps, if it is and if the index >= 2, we know that it is a multiple of 6
7. use an else if and determine if the i (index) - h[r] (which is the index value in hash) then, returns True
8. we can return False in the outer loop
